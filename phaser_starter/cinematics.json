But now, the song of protection falters.\n\nDeep beneath the peaceful village of Hearthwell, an ancient enemy stirs—the Echo Primordial. The earth trembles, and crystalline corruption bleeds from the depths.\n\nAs the shadows lengthen, a new hero must rise to restore the harmony before the silence takes us all.",

The Echo is listening... and it knows you are coming.",
